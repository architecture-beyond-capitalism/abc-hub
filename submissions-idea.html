    First, download the

    <div class="my-4">
      <button
        type="button"
        class="btn btn-primary"
        id="submission-templates"
        onclick="window.location.href= 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c7yiG8YXjJZJIwHXgH4sCKIQa-DcZmPP?usp=sharing';"

        Get Submission Templates
      </button>
    </div>
    Unlike <a href="Profile Submissions"></a> and
    <a href="Resource Submission"></a> submitting an entry to the glossary does
    not require that you fill out a metadata form. However, there are two
    different processes for for submitting a glossary entry.
    <ul>
      <li>A new glossary entry</li>
      <li>Extensions to an existing glossary entry</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>New Glossary Entry</h2>
    To create a new glossary entry, navigate to the
    <code>glossary-template</code> folder where you will find the
    <code>glossary-term.md</code> file. There you add the required meta-data
    manually (term name and author info) <br />
    <h2>Extensions to an existing glossary entry</h2>
    We hope that our collective understanding of the glossary terms are alive
    and evolving. To that end we hope in the future to develop a process for
    collective authorship of terms. For now, however, we are opening these term
    submissions as spaces spaces of asynchronous conversation that anthologize
    the various perspective community member have on the meaning of these vital
    terms. To add your perspective to an existing terms. First download the
    markdown document, go to the <code>_ideas</code> folder in the ABC Hub
    GitHub repository
    <a
      href="https://github.com/architecture-beyond-capitalism/abc-hub/tree/main/_ideas"
      >here</a
    >
    There you will see a list of all the markdown files currently included in
    the glossary. Navigate to the term you would like to contribute and click on
    it. Then click the download button for raw file download button (see below)
    to download the current markdown file.
    <div class="mt-3 mt-3">
      <img
        src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/github-idea-download.jpg"
        alt="image showing where download button is"
      />
    </div>

    With markdown file downloaded, you can edit the document by adding your
    author information and adding a new "block quote" section by adding a return
    and starting your new content with a <code>></code> and a space. For more
    sophisticated formating of your block quote refer to this
    <a href="https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/05-blockquotes.html"
      >quick tutorial.</a
    >
    At the end of the block quote be sure to provide your name and a link to
    your profile page. To do so, add copy and paste the text below and replace
    "your-name-slug" with your name-slug from your profile and your first name
    and last name.
    <div class="mt-3">
      <code>
        &lt;a
        href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/profile/your-name-slug-here"&gt;Firstname
        Lastname&lt;/a&gt;
      </code>
    </div>
    <h2>Submission via Google Drive or GitHub</h2>
    <p>
      Finally you will upload your named folder, which will include all the
      files associated with your submission via Google Drive or GitHub.
